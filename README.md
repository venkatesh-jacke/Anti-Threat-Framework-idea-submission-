The heart of Artificial Intelligence is data. Everything in AI is data. 
Suppose if the data itself corrupted, it could lead to serious damage to 
the system and to the environment. An attacker could make the data 
invalid, that could mistake the AI to change the behaviour of it. In order 
to avoid this kind attack, the AI must be trained to detect these kinds of
inputs along with its required dataset for proper functioning. With this 
pre-defined training we also need to make separate process that runs 
along with AI to detect the various invalid inputs in such case the AI is 
failed to detect it. For that purpose, we will implement a Time Series 
function along with its supporting models called ARCH/GARCH 
which can be used to predict the outcome of AI model ahead of one 
period which could make the fatal error and misbehaviour of AI
